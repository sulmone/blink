Tests default positioning of non-anchored dialogs.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Dialog should be centered in the viewport.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Dialog should be recentered if show() is called after close().
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Dialog should not be recentered on a relayout.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

A tall dialog should be positioned at the top of the viewport.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is 0
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is 0

The dialog should be centered regardless of the presence of a horizontal scrollbar.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Test that centering works when dialog is inside positioned containers.

PASS dialog.offsetTop is plainSpan.offsetTop

Test that setting 'bottom' on dialog results in the same position as for a plain, absolutely positioned span.
PASS dialog.offsetBottom is plainSpan.offsetBottom

Test that fixed positioning for dialog has same behavior as for a plain span.
PASS dialog.offsetTop is plainSpan.offsetTop
PASS dialog.offsetTop is plainSpan.offsetTop

Test that static position for a non-modal dialog has the same behavior as for a plain span.

Test that relative position for a non-modal dialog has the same behavior as for a plain span.
