DumpRenderTree runs with a default set of runtime flags enabled.
Thus the results in this directory serve to document Blink's
complete API as visible during testing.

Eventually we should add a virtual/stable test suite which runs only
with the flags exposed in the stable channel for more precise
web API testing. See http://crbug.com/234853
