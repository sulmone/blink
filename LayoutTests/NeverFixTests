# This file should only include tests that we never intend to fix.
# There should only be 4 categories of tests here:
#   1. Test harness tests.
#   2. Tests enabled by chromium embedders (e.g. Opera).
#   3. Tests that apply to some platforms but not others.
#   4. Tests that are too slow in Debug and so we only want to skip them in Debug.

# FIXME: Remove the WontFix keyword and have that be implied. That way, people won't abuse
# WontFix outside of this file.

# Perf tests are really slow in debug builds and there are few benefits in running them.

# This test verifies that a mismatch reftest will fail if both results are the
# same.  Because the whole point is that this test should fail when run, it's
# not SKIP, just WONTFIX.
